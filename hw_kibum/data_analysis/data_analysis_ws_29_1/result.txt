Road Traffic Act Amendment
This is a law that aims to resolve traffic problems on the road and

From April 20, 2022, a partial amendment to the Road Traffic Act 
became effective. The new amendment adds the definition of a 
“self-driving motor vehicle” as a motor vehicle (i) which can move 
on its own without the control of a driver or passenger, and (ii) 
is equipped with a self-driving system. A “self-driving system” 
means automated equipment, software and all other related 
devices that enable the motor vehicle to move by recognizing and 
judging surrounding circumstances and road information on its 
own without the input of a driver or passenger. In addition, using 
vehicles, horse-led carts, or trams on the road through a self-
driving system is also included in the definition of “driving.”

Collection System), and ATES (Automatic Traffic Enforcement System). The government provides national ITS data collected as
